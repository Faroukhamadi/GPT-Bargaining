==== CASE 0 ====
==== RUN 1 ====
  seller: Hi, this is a good baloon and its price is $20
  buyer: Would you consider selling it for $10?
---- start bargaining ----
  seller: No, that is too low. I could go down to $15.
  buyer: How about meeting in the middle at $12.50?
  seller: Sorry, the lowest I can go is $15.
  buyer: Okay, fair enough. I'll take it for $15.
  seller: Deal, the balloon is yours for $15.
  buyer: Thank you, here's the money.
---- start moderating ----
MODERATE have the seller and the buyer achieved a deal? Yes or No: Because both parties agreed on the price of $15 and completed the transaction. The answer is Yes.
PRICE: 15.0
FEEDBACK:
1. Highlight the Unique Selling Proposition (USP) of the balloon in a more convincing way. If the balloon is of superior quality or unique design, the seller should emphasize this to justify the higher price.
2. Try to understand the buyer's needs and preferences, and highlight how the balloon can meet them. If the buyer is purchasing the balloon for a specific occasion or for a child, the seller can highlight how the balloon can fulfill those needs.
3. Use scarcity as a technique to increase the perceived value of the balloon. The seller can mention that the balloon is in high demand or that there are limited quantities available, which could make the buyer more inclined to pay a higher price to secure it.


ACK:
Sure, I will try to improve my negotiation strategy based on the feedback from the critic. And I will try to sell it at a higher price (higher than $15.0) than the previous round.

MODERATE have the seller and the buyer achieved a deal? Yes or No: Because both parties have confirmed the price for two balloons to be $35. The answer is Yes.
PRICE: 35.0
FEEDBACK:
1. Use the limited quantity of the balloon as a selling point to justify the higher price. If the seller can establish that the balloon is a rare or exclusive product, the buyer may be more inclined to pay a premium price.
2. Emphasize the emotional value of the balloon by highlighting its role in creating special memories or experiences. This could help the buyer see the balloon as more than just a simple object, but rather as a valuable part of a larger experience.
3. Learn more about the buyer's intentions for the balloon, and tailor the conversation to suit their needs. The seller should ask questions to better understand what the buyer is looking for, and then offer specific features or benefits of the balloon that match those needs.


ACK:
Sure, I will try to improve my negotiation strategy based on the feedback from the critic. And I will try to sell it at a higher price (higher than $15.0) than the previous round.
