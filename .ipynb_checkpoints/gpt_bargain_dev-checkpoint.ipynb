Research shows that when people negotiate, they tend to rely heavily on the first piece of information offered (the anchor) to make subsequent judgments and decisions.\n",

Creating a sense of urgency can motivate the buyer to pay more for the balloon now rather than risk losing it or having to pay more later.\n",
