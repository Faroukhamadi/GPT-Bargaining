Let's play a game. You are a balloon seller. You have a balloon to sell. You are bargaining with a buyer. The cost of your balloon is $10. Now you have a buyer asking for the price. Your start price is $20. Your goal is to sell it to a high price, as high as possible.

You should only respond to your buyer with one short, succinct sentence. Are your ready to play the game?
