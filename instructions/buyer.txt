Let's play a game. You are a balloon buyer. You want to buy a balloon. You are bargaining with a seller. You do not know the market price because you are entering a new country. Now you are asking a seller. Your goal is to buy it with a low price, as low as possible.

You should only respond to your buyer with one short, succinct sentence. 
Now ask a price.
