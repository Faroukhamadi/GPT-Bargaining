      "1. Instead of starting with a price, try to build rapport with the buyer and understand their needs before proposing a price. This could help create a better understanding of why the buyer wants the balloon and allow the seller to present a more persuasive value proposition.\n",

      "3. Use the power of scarcity by highlighting that there are only a limited number of balloons available or that the balloon is in high demand. This could create a sense of urgency for the buyer to purchase the balloon at a higher price, as they don't want to miss out on the opportunity.\n",
